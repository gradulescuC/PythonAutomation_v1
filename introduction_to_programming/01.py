# A. PRINT FUNCTION
from math import floor, ceil  # here we import an external library

print("Hello world!") #print is a python instruction that help us display text on the screen
print("Mc. \"Donalds") # the \ sign can be used as what we call an escape mechanism
                            # the escape mechanism makes a character be considered text to be displayed on the screen instead of part of the code
print ("Mc 'Donalds'") # we can also make use of a mixture of quotes and double quotes in order to not use the escape character in this case

# B. VARIABLES

""" 
1. A variable is a reserved space in the system memory that can store information that can be changed over time
2. A variable must be defined by a name that will represent the name of the memory where the variable is defined
3. Variables will be created only after assigning them a value to be stored in the memory that is reserved
4. Rules for naming a variable
- variable names must not contain spaces
- variable names must not be named with reserved words (for example we cannot name a variable as print)
- variable names must be unique
- variable names must not start with a number (they can contain numbers as long as they do not start with one)
- usually variables follow the format snake_case or camelCase (usually snake_case)
- variable names should start with lowercase
- variables are case sensitive

# C. CONSTANTS
"""
- Constants are memory spaces that should not change their value
- In python the concept of constant does not exist, so when we want to defined constants, as a convention we will use capitals as a name

# E. DATA TYPES
"""
A data type is an information that informs the system about the type of information we can store in a specific variable

The most used data types in python:
- int (short for integer) -> Can store only integer values (1,2,9,99,167834534 etc)
- float -> Can store decimal numbers (16 decimal points)
- bool (short for boolean) -> Can store true or false values  (with first letter in capital letter)
- string -> Can store text
