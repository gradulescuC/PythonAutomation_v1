1. Python comments
a) single line comments are to be marked with # (shortcut is CTRL + /)
b) multi line comments are to be marked with triple quotes (""")

2. The main rule in any programming language is that any pharanthesys that is opened must be closed, and any quotes that are open must be closed

3. Structure of an if statement:
- begining of the decision (if)
- condition to be evaluated
- then (the set of instructions/statements to be executed if the condition is evaluated as TRUE
                            - it does not have an explicit markup in pyhton - represented by the start of the indentation)
- else (the set of instructions/statements to be executed if the condition is evaluated as FALSE)
- elif (secondary condition to be evaluated in case we want to evaluate multiple conditions)
- endif (the end of the if statement - does not have an explicit markup in pyhton - represented by the end of the indentation)
